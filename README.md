# Mr. RoBot. Bitcoin (and other crypto)-predictor
### Created by: Rodrigo DÃ­az-Lupanow

Results show 90% success in predicting next day's price on many cripto.

This is a multi-plataform software (for Linux, Windows and Mac).

Required software: Docker. 

Docker will create a container running Debian and will install R (r-base), git, wget, lynx. After that it will download script from this github and install required R packages (randomForest, dplyr, MASS, lubridate, zoo). Finally, a script with the algorithm will be executated.
